# HyFly
This repository is for the M2I HyFly group as a space to put code for reviewing, editing, and documenting.  
## Expectations 
### Documentation / commenting
When creating code for projects that multiple people will be working on over time documentation is important. People will need to be able to follow your program even if they aren't fluent in programming. That is why there should be a lot of comments in your code to help people follow along. If you know how to use Doxygen for documentation generationor something similar it would be apperiatated if you use it. When you create a new method, you should write a comment right above it and explain what the inputs and outputs are if there are any and what it will do. Whenever you create a section that took you a bit to figure out how to code it, you should be making a commen.t about it explaining it and what it does. 
### Best practices
When coding you should make sure that your code has a consistant formate to it so that it looks clean (if you are confussed on what this might look like just do a quick search for C Coding best practices). Your varible names should make some logical sense. For example, don't be naming variables like *gas* for the volume of gas being read, instead it should be something like *GasVolume* or *gas_vol* (again I don't care if you use camelcase or underscores just be consistant). 
### Branching
It's a good idea to work in a separate branch if you are working on code in the same file as someone else. Whenever, get your section done then you can create a pull request and make sure that it will merge properly with the main branch. This way if we create accidently create something that messes up other parts of the code that are working correctly then we have a chance to fix it. If it's not merging properly don't force it because there may be an issue that went unresolved. 
### Commit and Push
I know it may be annoying to have to type in a message for every commit that you do which is every time you what to save, but be specific on what you have done. Also try to commit and push as much as possible, like I said earlier this is escentially your save button.
